# scrape_audible

This project was designed to scrape pages of the audiobook website Audible for summary information about each book. I used the code to scrape the top 1,200 best sellers (as of Jan 2020) in the scifi fantasy category and preform some exploritory analysis.

The scraping functions work on all book list pages, automatically moving though the pages of the list until it reaches Audble's page limit. The scraper collects information about the book title, author(s), series, narrator(s), length, publishing year, and average listener rating where the information is available.
